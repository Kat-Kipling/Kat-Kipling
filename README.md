Kat Kipling - They/Them
Fullstack developer but primarily interested in backend development and working with database engines. Also enjoys working on in-house software. Programs in C# and Java mainly. Currently learning AngularJS and .NET Core to develop single page applications. I'll make this look better *eventually*
